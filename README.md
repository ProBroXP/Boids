# Boids using p5 library

A simple implementation of [this algorithm](https://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/). 
At first, I tried using a naive approach of finding each boid's neighbors by looping through the entire list of boids. This version uses spacial hashing along with a few other smaller optimizations to drastically improve performance.
